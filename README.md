# KSS Exploration

I've dissected and documented KSS for my needs. Maybe you'll find this helpful too?

## First steps

I'd like to use KSS to create style guides for Drupal 8 projects. `kss-node` is a project that expands on the original KSS and adds some useful additions.

* Install [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node) with `npm install --save-dev kss-node`. 
* You could install it globally, but why?
* So how do you run it from the local package? `./node_modules/.bin/kss`. No one has time for that though.
* `npm install -g npm-run`. Yes, globally. [This'll let you run local modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run) like a champ. 
* `npm run kss` to see kss options.

## There are a lot of options
